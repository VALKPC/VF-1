The [STEP file](VF1-V2-0-Export.step), together with the [BOM](BOM.md) and [user manual](/VF-1%20User%20Manual.pdf), presents a complete set of instructions on how to build the VALKPC.

All flat panels are designed as 3mm sheet that can be cut/CNC from a wide variety of materials, e.g. Carbon fiber, hard wood, resin or composite panels.
To ease sourcing of all needed components, a [barebones kit is available](https://valkpc.com/products/vf-1-barebones-kit).

Happy modding!
